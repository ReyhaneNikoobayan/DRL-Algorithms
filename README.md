# DRL-Algorithms

# 🧠 Deep Reinforcement Learning Portfolio

A curated collection of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** algorithms implemented **from scratch** using PyTorch and Gymnasium.  

The goals of this repository are to:

- 🎯 Understand and implement core RL and DRL algorithms from scratch  
- 🧩 Build fundamental components (replay buffers, target networks, policy gradients, etc.) manually  
- 📈 Train and evaluate agents on classic control environments  
- 📚 Provide clear, educational code for others studying reinforcement learning  

This repository includes **tabular methods**, **value-based deep RL**, and **policy-gradient methods**, tested on well-known Gymnasium environments such as:

- CartPole-v1  
- FrozenLake-v1  
- MountainCar-v0  
- LunarLander-v2  
- Acrobot-v1

## 🌟 Why this project?

Reinforcement Learning is best learned through **hands-on implementation**.  
By coding each algorithm step-by-step, I aim to deeply understand how RL works behind the scenes.

This repository is an evolving portfolio and a demonstration of my progress in DRL.
